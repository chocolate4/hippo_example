    "We will showcase how OpenAI's Embedding API can be used with our vector database to turn user questions into Hippo query conditions. Then, by conducting a similarity search, we can find text that can answer the user's question. Next, the user's question and text are concatenated into a prompt, which serves as the input for OpenAI's Chat API. Finally, we receive a response from the Chat API offered by OpenAI.\n",
